# Hi there 👋

**This is created especially for INFO 591 at Drexel, for the spring 2023 term.**

## Here's an interesting dataset I've found...
- [The Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum collection dataset](https://github.com/cooperhewitt/collection)
  - part of the Smithsonian museums, the dataset can be downloaded as a CSV containing over 130K objects and 26 metadata fields, explained [here](url) on their wiki.

## 🤩 STARS... ⭐️
- [LibraryCarpentry's OpenRefine](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-open-refine)
- [Awesome Digital Preservation from digipress]([url](https://github.com/digipres/awesome-digital-preservation))


*KK, that's all for now. It's really a very simple readme page!*
